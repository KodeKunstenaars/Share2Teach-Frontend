# Share 2 Teach

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Share2Teach Frontend usage guide. This document provides an overview of the frontend interface, explaining how users can interact with the platform to access and share educational resources. It outlines the key features available on the Share2Teach platform and offers insights on how to navigate the interface effectively.

## Introduction

Share2Teach is an Open Educational Resource (OER) platform designed to build a community of learners and educators by encouraging the sharing of knowledge. The frontend of Share2Teach acts as the user-facing interface, providing an intuitive experience for managing and accessing educational resources. With React.js at its core, the frontend ensures a responsive and interactive user experience.

Key features of the Share2Teach frontend include:

- User Authentication: Easy registration and login processes with role-based access control.
- Educational Resources: Browse, upload, and manage documents with metadata directly from the interface.
- User Interactions: Rate, report, and search for resources to enhance the learning experience.
  
 Built with React.js for a dynamic, component-based structure, the frontend leverages Bootstrap CSS to ensure a modern, responsive design, providing seamless accessibility across devices and screen sizes. This guide will help you make the most of the platformâ€™s features from the user interface.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
